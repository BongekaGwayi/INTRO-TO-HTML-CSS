1.What is HTML?
HTML is utilized wherever that web technology is involved, including in websites, applications, and other software. It acts as a conduit for a variety of content, including forms, audio, video, photos, words, and interactive activities. It essentially creates a strong base upon which everything else in the digital world is built. 

Computers speak their own language, called programming languages, which are distinguished by their logical and consistent structure, in contrast to people who communicate in complex languages with many words and nuances. The interface between computer and human languages is the internet. 
People or other machines program websites, which they subsequently use. The goal of artificial intelligence is to give computers the ability to understand human behavior intelligently. What if it were possible to guarantee that every machine could comprehend human speech on

2.HTLM TEXT FORMATTING

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides various tags for formatting text on web pages. Here is a summary of some commonly used HTML text formatting tags:

Headings (<h1> to <h6>):

<h1> to <h6> tags are used to define headings of different levels, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Paragraph (<p>):

The <p> tag is used to define paragraphs. Text enclosed within <p> tags is displayed with space above and below.
Bold (<strong> or <b>):

The <strong> and <b> tags are used to make text bold. <strong> is semantically preferred as it indicates strong importance.
Italic (<em> or <i>):

The <em> and <i> tags are used to make text italic. <em> is semantically preferred as it indicates emphasis.
Underline (<u>):

The <u> tag is used to underline text. However, it's generally recommended to use CSS for styling, as <u> may not be supported in the latest HTML versions.
Strikethrough (<s> or <strike> or <del>):

The <s>, <strike>, and <del> tags are used to create strikethrough text, indicating that it should be deleted or no longer valid.
Subscript (<sub>):

The <sub> tag is used to render text as subscript, typically used for mathematical or chemical formulas.
Superscript (<sup>):

The <sup> tag is used to render text as superscript, often used for footnotes or exponent notation.
Line Break (<br>):

The <br> tag is used to insert a line break within text, forcing the text following it to appear on the next line.
Horizontal Line (<hr>):

The <hr> tag is used to create a horizontal line, providing a visual break in the content.
Code (<code>):

3.HTML Capabilities

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as the foundational language for structuring and presenting content on the web. Its key capabilities include:

Document Structure: HTML organizes content hierarchically using tags, establishing a structured tree-like format for web pages.

Text and Multimedia: Supports text elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
Allows embedding multimedia elements such as images, audio, and video.

Forms: Provides form elements for user input, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons.
Enables data submission to servers for processing.

Semantic Markup: Offers semantic tags (e.g., <article>, <section>) to convey the meaning and structure of content, aiding in search engine optimization and accessibility.

Hyperlinks: Allows the creation of hyperlinks using the <a> tag for navigation between pages and resources.
Tables: Supports the creation of tables (<table>) for presenting tabular data using <tr>, <td>, and related tags.

Metadata: Includes metadata elements like <meta> to provide information about the document, such as character encoding and viewport settings.

Style and Presentation: While HTML defines the structure, styling is typically handled by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control the visual presentation.

Scripts and Interactivity: Permits the integration of scripts, often written in JavaScript, for adding interactivity and dynamic features to web pages.

Responsive Design: Supports responsive design principles, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

Accessibility:Incorporates features such as alt attributes for images and semantic markup to enhance accessibility, catering to users with disabilities.

Versioning: HTML evolves over time, with different versions introducing new features and improvements. HTML5 is the latest version, offering enhanced capabilities and compatibility.

4.HTML Navigation and linking

HTML navigation and linking are essential aspects of building a cohesive and user-friendly web experience. Here's a summary of HTML navigation and linking capabilities:

Hyperlinks (<a> Tag): The <a> (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages or resources.
Hyperlinks can point to external URLs or internal page locations.

Internal Page Links: Internal links are created using the href attribute within the <a> tag, linking to specific sections within the same webpage using anchor names or IDs.

Navigation Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>): Lists (<ul> for unordered, <ol> for ordered) can be used to create navigation menus.
Each menu item is represented by a list item (<li>), often containing hyperlinks.

Navigation Bars: Navigation bars are commonly implemented using a combination of <ul>, <li>, and <a> elements, styled with CSS to create a horizontal or vertical menu.

Navigation within Forms: Links can be used within forms to guide users to different sections or provide additional information.

Image Links (<a> around <img>): Images can be turned into links by wrapping them with an <a> tag, allowing users to navigate when clicking on the image.

Target Attribute: The target attribute within the <a> tag can be used to specify how the linked content should be displayed (e.g., in a new tab or window).

Linking to Email Addresses (mailto:): The mailto: protocol allows creating links that open the user's email client, pre-populating the recipient's email address.

Base Element: The <base> element allows setting a base URL for all relative URLs within a document, simplifying the management of links.
Link Relationships (rel Attribute): The rel attribute within the <a> tag can define the relationship between the current document and the linked resource (e.g., stylesheet, icon).
